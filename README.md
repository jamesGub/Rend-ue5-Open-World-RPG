# Rend-ue5-Open-World-RPG
Version control for my Unreal Engine 5 project, "Rend", an open-world RPG.

# This game was created as a part of Stephen Ulibarri's course on Udemy, "Unreal Engine 5 C++ The Ultimate Game Developer Course".
# With over 230 lectures and 50 hours of content, this course covers a variety of subjects in-depth, such as: 
- Event scripting with C++ and Blueprints, going over how to implement logic with either event system.
- The very basics of Unreal Engine 5 all the way to the necessary components and game mechanics to create large-scale projects.
- Specific subjects include: Animation, Combat, Character Movement, Open-World Landscape Creation, Controls, and much more.

# This repo contains source control for my project, with content, scripts, and edits pushed continually to show progress. 
# This repo is NOT representative of the entire project, as I have already done the bulk of it before creating this, however I will include screenshots and start-to-finish progression as I see fit.
